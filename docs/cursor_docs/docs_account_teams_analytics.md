# Usage Analytics

Usage Analytics are available for Team and Enterprise customers.

The Cursor [Web Dashboard](https://cursor.com/dashboard?tab=analytics-v2) provides usage analytics so you can understand how your team is using Cursor.

## Data Access and Visibility

Team admins have access to data for themselves and all other users in the team. Team members without admin privileges can see data for themselves and in some cases (like the Usage Leaderboard) for select other users on the team.

Analytics data is collected only from users running client version 1.5 or higher.

### CSV Download

Each chart has a button on the bottom-right corner which allows for CSV download of visible data. Additionally, users can download data for all charts by clicking the download icon in the page header.

### API Access

See our [Admin API documentation](/docs/account/teams/analytics-api) to access analytics data programmatically. Available only for Enterprise customers.

## Filtering Data

Dashboard users can filter usage shown for specific users, [active directory groups](/docs/account/teams/scim#managing-users-and-groups), and dates via the header. Filtering supports up to 10 users and 90 continuous days of data.

Clicking on the gear icon in the header allows users to select timezone as well as whether weekends are shown.

## Tracking AI Code in Git Commits

Cursor keeps a log of the signature of every AI line (Tab or Agent) that is suggested to the user during their chat session.

These lines are stored and later compared to the signatures of each line in subsequent git commits that were written by the same author. Cursor will detect all the line changes (additions or deletions) written by the Cursor Agent or Tab, and attribute the line as being written by AI.

All the AI detection is done on device, and never leaves the user's computer. We store the line counts as metadata and make them available via API or in the Analytics Dashboard.

#### Known Limitations:

Diff signatures may be invalidated if automated code formatting is modifying lines.

AI Code Tracking has not been implemented for Background Agents, or the Cursor CLI yet.

All code signatures are stored on-device. The git commit must be scored on the same machine as the AI code was authored.

## AI Output

### AI Share of Committed Code

AI Share of Committed Code shows the lines of code changed in commits to your repositories, and what % of that code was generated by Cursor. Users can filter for production branch, which will use:

The optional default branch set to the git repo

Fallback to common default branch names such as: `main`, `master`, `production`, `prod`.

We use the following definitions:

Cursor AI: Any line that can be attributed to Cursor Agent or Tab based on diff signatures.

Other: Any line of code that can't be detected as being written by Cursor

### Agent Edits

Agent Edits shows the amount of code edited by the IDE agent, and Cmd+K, and whether those changes were accepted by the user. Viewers can group the data by suggested / accepted or by file extension.

### Tab Completions

Tab Completions shows the number of times Tab code has been suggested (and accepted) by users. The unit is Tab suggestions, regardless of lines of code changed in that suggestion.

You can access the number of lines of code suggested by Tab through the [Analytics API](/docs/account/teams/analytics-api).

### Messages Sent

Messages Sent shows the number of messages sent by users to the IDE. Users can filter this data by the mode (e.g., Agent, Ask, Cmd+K) or by models used.

## Active Users

The Active Users chart shows the number of unique active Cursor users in your team across different products. A user is defined as active in a period if they use at least one AI feature (Tab, Agent, Background Agent, CLI). Bugbot users are synced to Github accounts (not Cursor) and therefore not included in the `All` active user rollup.

## Daily Usage

The Daily Usage chart visualizes Cursor activity over the preceding 365 days.

Users can toggle to see this view by:

All: shows lines of code edits suggested by AI in the IDE (Tab and Agent).

Tab: shows the number of suggestions made by Tab.

Agent: shows lines of code suggested by Agent.

DAU: shows daily active users across all Cursor products.

Data collection for this chart starts in early September for customers on the 1.5+ IDE release.

## Usage Leaderboard

The Usage Leaderboard shows top Cursor users across your team alongside their favorite model and select usage stats for the selected time period.

We provide the following metrics:

Chats: number of messages sent by the user in the chat interface (Agent, Plan Mode, Ask Mode, etc).

Tab Completions: number of Tab suggestions accepted by the user.

Agent Lines of Code: Lines of code written by the Agent and accepted by the user.

The top ten users and any filtered users are always shown. All users in the team are able to view the leaderboard.

## Repository Insights

Repository Insights allow you to see how Cursor is used across different repositories. We report on:

AI Lines of Code Committed: Code written by Cursor (Tab and IDE Agent) that was committed by a user.

Total Lines of Code Committed: All code committed by users.

Code Committed by AI %: The % of lines of code committed that were edited by Cursor (Tab and IDE Agent).

Some commits will be associated with `Unknown` repository if the user makes commits to a local git repository that doesn't contain a remote origin, or a remote that couldn't be resolved by the Cursor IDE

## Cloud Agent Usage

### Agents Created

Agents Created shows Cloud Agent usage by the originating source. Each time a Cloud Agent starts up counts as one Agent.

### Pull Requests

Pull Requests shows Pull Requests Opened and Merged that originate from Cloud Agents.

### Lines of Code

Lines of Code shows code written and merged by Cloud Agents.

## Cloud Agent Top Repositories

Cloud Agent Top Repositories shows repositories by number of Pull Requests opened and merged.

## Top Cloud Agent Users

Top Cloud Agent Users shows top users by number of Agents Created. Viewers can also view data by Pull Requests opened and merged.

## Client Versions

Client Versions shows which versions of the Cursor IDE your team is using. Each user's version is the Cursor version they last opened during that day.
