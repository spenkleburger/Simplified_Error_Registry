Configuration
# JetBrains Migration

Cursor offers a modern, AI-powered coding experience that can replace your JetBrains IDEs. While the transition might feel different at first, Cursor's VS Code-based foundation provides powerful features and extensive customization options.

Don't want to migrate? You can still use [Cursor CLI](/docs/cli/overview) with your JetBrains IDEs.

## Editor Components

### Extensions

JetBrains IDEs are great tools, as they come already pre-configured for the languages and frameworks they are intended for.

Cursor is different - being a blank canvas out of the box, you can customize it to your liking, not being limited by the languages and frameworks the IDE was intended for.

Cursor has access to a vast ecosystem of extensions, and almost all of the functionality (and more!) that JetBrains IDEs offer can be recreated through these extensions.

Take a look at some of these popular extensions below:

[Remote SSH](cursor:extension/anysphere.remote-ssh) - SSH Extension
[Project Manager](cursor:extension/alefragnani.project-manager) - Manage multiple projects
[GitLens](cursor:extension/eamodio.gitlens) - Enhanced Git integration
[Local History](cursor:extension/xyz.local-history) - Track local file changes
[Error Lens](cursor:extension/usernamehw.errorlens) - Inline error highlighting
[ESLint](cursor:extension/dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) - Code linting
[Prettier](cursor:extension/esbenp.prettier-vscode) - Code formatting
[Todo Tree](cursor:extension/Gruntfuggly.todo-tree) - Track TODOs and FIXMEs

### Keyboard Shortcuts

Cursor has a built-in keyboard shortcut manager that allows you to map your favorite keyboard shortcuts to actions.

With the [IntelliJ IDEA Keybindings](cursor:extension/k--kato.intellij-idea-keybindings) extension, you can bring almost all of the JetBrains IDEs shortcuts directly to Cursor!
Be sure to read the extension's documentation to learn how to configure it to your liking.

Common shortcuts that differ:

Find Action: ⌘/Ctrl+Shift+P  (vs. ⌘/Ctrl+Shift+A)
Quick Fix: ⌘/Ctrl+.  (vs. Alt+Enter)
Go to File: ⌘/Ctrl+P  (vs. ⌘/Ctrl+Shift+N)

### Themes

Recreate the look and feel of your favorite JetBrains IDEs in Cursor with these community themes.

Choose from the standard Darcula Theme, or pick a theme to match the syntax highlighting of your JetBrains tools.

[JetBrains - Darcula Theme](cursor:extension/rokoroku.vscode-theme-darcula) - Experience the classic JetBrains Darcula dark theme
[JetBrains PyCharm](cursor:extension/gabemahoney.pycharm-dark-theme-for-python)
[IntelliJ](cursor:extension/compassak.intellij-idea-new-ui)
[JetBrains Fleet](cursor:extension/MichaelZhou.fleet-theme)
[JetBrains Rider](cursor:extension/muhammad-sammy.rider-theme)
[JetBrains Icons](cursor:extension/ardonplay.vscode-jetbrains-icon-theme) - Get the familiar JetBrains file and folder icons

### Font

To complete your JetBrains-like experience, you can use the official JetBrains Mono font:

[Download JetBrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/) and install it onto your system:
Restart Cursor after installing the font
Open Settings in Cursor (⌘/Ctrl + ,)
Search for "Font Family"
Set the font family to `'JetBrains Mono'`

For the best experience, you can also enable font ligatures by setting `"editor.fontLigatures": true` in your settings.
