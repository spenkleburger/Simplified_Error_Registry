# Review

When Agent generates code changes, they're presented in a review interface that shows additions and deletions with color-coded lines. This allows you to examine and control which changes are applied to your codebase.

The review interface displays code changes in a familiar diff format:

## Diffs

TypeMeaningExampleAdded linesNew code additions`+ const newVariable = 'hello';`Deleted linesCode removals`- const oldVariable = 'goodbye';`Context linesUnchanged surrounding code` function example() `

## Agent Review

Agent Review runs Cursor Agent in a specialized mode focused on catching bugs in your diffs. This tool analyzes proposed changes line-by-line and flags issues before you merge.

Want automatic reviews on your PRs?
Check out [Bugbot](/docs/bugbot), which applies advanced analysis to catch issues early and suggest improvements automatically on every pull request.

There are two ways to use Agent Review: in the agent diff and in the source control tab.

### Agent diff

Review the output of an agent diff: after a response, click Review, then click Find Issues to analyze the proposed edits and suggest follow-ups.

### Source control

Review all changes against your main branch: open the Source Control tab and run Agent Review to review all local changes compared to your main branch.

### Billing

Running Agent Review triggers an agent run and is billed as a usage-based request.

### Settings

You can configure Agent Review in the Cursor settings.

## Review UI

After generation completes, you'll see a prompt to review all changes before proceeding. This gives you an overview of what will be modified.

### File-by-file

A floating review bar appears at the bottom of your screen, allowing you to:

Accept or reject changes for the current file
Navigate to the next file with pending changes

Your browser does not support the video tag.

### Selective acceptance
