# Cursor Agent

Agent is Cursor's assistant that can complete complex coding tasks independently, run terminal commands, and edit code. Access in sidepane with Cmd+ICtrl+I.

Learn more about [how agents work](/learn/agents) and help your build faster.

[## Browser](/docs/agent/browser)
Agent can interact with web browsers to test applications, gather
information, and perform web-based tasks autonomously.
[## Tools](/docs/agent/tools)
Agent uses tools to search, edit, and run commands. From semantic codebase
search to terminal execution, these tools enable autonomous task
completion. Includes MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration for enhanced capabilities.
[## Rules](/docs/context/rules)
Define custom instructions for Agent behavior. Rules help maintain coding
standards, enforce patterns, and personalize how Agent assists with your
project.
[## Checkpoints](/docs/agent/chat/checkpoints)
Automatic snapshots track Agent's changes. Restore previous states if
changes don't work as expected or to try different approaches.
[## Todos](/docs/agent/planning)
Agent creates and manages structured task lists for complex projects. Use
todos as a planning document to break down work into manageable steps
and track progress.
[## Hooks](/docs/agent/hooks)
Extend Agent capabilities with custom hooks. Create reusable functions
that integrate with your workflow and automate repetitive tasks.
[## Parallel](/docs/agent/chat/tabs)
Run multiple conversations simultaneously with Cmd+TCtrl+T. Each tab
maintains its own context, history, and model selection.
[## Terminal](/docs/agent/terminal)
Agent executes terminal commands, monitors output, and handles multi-step
processes. Configure auto-run for trusted workflows or require
confirmation for safety.
[## Diffs](/docs/agent/review)
Examine changes before accepting them. Review interface shows additions
and deletions with color-coded lines for control over modifications.
[## Autocomplete](/docs/agent/autocomplete)
AI-powered code completion that understands your codebase context. Get
intelligent suggestions that go beyond simple syntax completion.
[## Chat History](/docs/agent/chat/history)
Access past conversations with Opt Cmd 'Alt Ctrl '. Review previous
discussions, track coding sessions, and reference context from earlier
chats.
[## Export Chats](/docs/agent/chat/export)
Export conversations to markdown format. Share solutions with team
members, document decisions, or create knowledge bases from coding
sessions.
