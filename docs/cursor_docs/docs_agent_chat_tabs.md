# Tabs

## Overview

Press Cmd+TCtrl+T to create new tabs. Each tab maintains separate conversation history, context, and model selection.

For parallel workflows, try [Cloud Agents](/docs/cloud-agent)

## Managing tabs

Create new tabs with Cmd+TCtrl+T. Each tab starts with a fresh conversation and maintains its own context.
Switch between tabs by clicking their headers or using Ctrl+Tab to cycle through them.
Tab titles are auto-generated after the first message. Rename them by right-clicking on the tab header.

Use one task per tab, provide clear initial descriptions, and close finished
tabs to keep your workspace organized.

### Conflicts

Cursor prevents multiple tabs from editing the same files. You'll be prompted to resolve conflicts.
