Check out our [learning guides](/learn) covering [AI models](/learn/how-ai-models-work), [context](/learn/context), [agents](/learn/agents), and more.

[## Tab](/docs/tab/overview)
Code completion that predicts multi-line edits. Press Tab to accept
suggestions based on your current code and recent changes.
[## Agent](/docs/agent/overview)
An AI that can read and modify code across multiple files. Describe
changes in natural language and Agent executes them.
[## Inline Edit](/docs/inline-edit/overview)
Edit selected code with natural language. Press Cmd+KCtrl+K to
describe changes and see them applied in place.
[## Chat](/docs/agent/chat/tabs)
Interface for AI conversations. Supports multiple tabs, conversation
history, checkpoints, and export functionality.
[## Rules](/docs/context/rules)
Custom instructions that define AI behavior. Set coding standards,
framework preferences, and project-specific conventions.
[## Codebase Indexing](/docs/context/codebase-indexing)
Semantic analysis of your codebase. Enables code search, reference
finding, and context-aware suggestions.
[## MCP](/docs/context/mcp)
Model Context Protocol for integrating external tools. Connects to
databases, APIs, and documentation sources.
[## Context](/learn/context)
Information provided to AI models during code generation. Includes files,
symbols, and conversation history.
[## Models](/docs/models)
Different AI models available for code generation. Each model has
different speed and capability characteristics.
