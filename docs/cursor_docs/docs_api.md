# Cursor APIs Overview

Cursor provides multiple APIs for programmatic access to your team's data, AI-powered coding agents, and analytics.

## Available APIs

## Authentication

All Cursor APIs use Basic Authentication.

### Basic Authentication

Use your API key as the username in basic authentication (leave password empty):

```
curl https://api.cursor.com/teams/members \
  -u YOUR_API_KEY:
```

Or set the Authorization header directly:

```
Authorization: Basic {base64_encode('YOUR_API_KEY:')}
```

### Creating API Keys

API keys are created from your team settings. Only team administrators can create and manage API keys.

#### Admin API & AI Code Tracking API

Navigate to cursor.com/dashboard → Settings tab → Advanced → Admin API Keys
Click Create New API Key
Give your key a descriptive name (e.g., "Usage Dashboard Integration")
Copy the generated key immediately - you won't see it again

Key format: `key_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`

#### Analytics API

Generate an API key from your [team settings page](https://cursor.com/settings).

#### Cloud Agents API

Create an API key from [Cursor Dashboard → Integrations](https://cursor.com/dashboard?tab=integrations).

API keys are tied to your organization and viewable by all admins. Keys are unaffected by the original creator's account status.

## Rate Limits

All APIs implement rate limiting to ensure fair usage and system stability. Rate limits are enforced per team and reset every minute.

### Rate Limits by API

### Rate Limit Response

When you exceed the rate limit, you'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response:

```
{
  "error": "Too Many Requests",
  "message": "Rate limit exceeded. Please try again later."
}
```

## Caching

Several APIs support HTTP caching with ETags to reduce bandwidth usage and improve performance.

### Supported APIs

Analytics API: All endpoints (both team-level and by-user) support HTTP caching
AI Code Tracking API: Endpoints support HTTP caching

### How Caching Works

Initial Request: Make a request to any supported endpoint
Response Includes ETag: The API returns an `ETag` header in the response
Subsequent Requests: Include the `ETag` value in an `If-None-Match` header
304 Not Modified: If data hasn't changed, you'll receive a `304 Not Modified` response with no body

### Example

```
# Initial request
curl -X GET "https://api.cursor.com/analytics/team/dau" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -D headers.txt

# Response includes: ETag: "abc123xyz"

# Subsequent request with ETag
curl -X GET "https://api.cursor.com/analytics/team/dau" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "If-None-Match: \"abc123xyz\""

# Returns 304 Not Modified if data hasn't changed
```

### Cache Duration

Cache duration: 15 minutes (`Cache-Control: public, max-age=900`)
Responses include an `ETag` header
Include `If-None-Match` header in subsequent requests to receive `304 Not Modified` when data hasn't changed

### Benefits

Reduces bandwidth usage: 304 responses contain no body
Faster responses: Avoids processing unchanged data
Rate limit friendly: 304 responses don't count against rate limits
Better performance: Especially useful for frequently polled endpoints

## Best Practices

### 1. Implement Exponential Backoff

When you receive a 429 response, wait before retrying with increasing delays:

```
import time
import requests

def make_request_with_backoff(url, headers, max_retries=5):
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
        
        if response.status_code == 429:
            # Exponential backoff: 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s
            wait_time = 2 ** attempt
            print(f"Rate limited. Waiting {wait_time}s before retry...")
            time.sleep(wait_time)
            continue
            
        return response
    
    raise Exception("Max retries exceeded")
```

### 2. Distribute Requests Over Time

Spread your API calls over time rather than making burst requests:

Schedule batch jobs to run at different intervals
Add delays between requests when processing large datasets
Use queuing systems to smooth out traffic spikes

### 3. Leverage Caching

For Analytics API and AI Code Tracking API:

These APIs support HTTP caching with ETags. See the [Caching](#caching) section above for details on how to use ETags to reduce bandwidth usage and avoid unnecessary requests.

Key benefits:

Reduces bandwidth usage
Faster responses when data hasn't changed
Doesn't count against rate limits (for 304 responses)

Use date shortcuts (`7d`, `30d`) instead of timestamps for better caching support in Analytics API.

### 4. Monitor Your Usage

Track your request patterns to stay within limits:

Log API call timestamps and response codes
Set up alerts for 429 responses
Monitor daily/weekly usage trends
Adjust polling intervals based on actual needs

### 5. Batch Wisely

For endpoints with pagination:

Use appropriate page sizes to get more data per request
For Analytics API by-user endpoints: Use `users` parameter to filter specific users
For large data extractions: Use CSV endpoints when available (they stream data efficiently)

### 6. Poll at Appropriate Intervals

Don't over-poll endpoints that update infrequently:

Admin API `/teams/daily-usage-data`: Poll at most once per hour (data aggregated hourly)
Admin API `/teams/filtered-usage-events`: Poll at most once per hour (data aggregated hourly)
Analytics API: Use date shortcuts (`7d`, `30d`) for better caching support
AI Code Tracking API: Data is ingested in near real-time but polling every few minutes is sufficient

### 7. Handle Errors Gracefully

Implement proper error handling for all API calls:

```
async function fetchAnalytics(endpoint) {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(`https://api.cursor.com${endpoint}`, {
      headers: {
        'Authorization': `Basic ${btoa(API_KEY + ':')}`
      }
    });
    
    if (response.status === 429) {
      // Rate limited - implement backoff
      throw new Error('Rate limit exceeded');
    }
    
    if (response.status === 401) {
      // Invalid API key
      throw new Error('Authentication failed');
    }
    
    if (response.status === 403) {
      // Insufficient permissions
      throw new Error('Enterprise access required');
    }
    
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(`API error: ${response.status}`);
    }
    
    return await response.json();
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('API request failed:', error);
    throw error;
  }
}
```

## Common Error Responses

All APIs use standard HTTP status codes:

### 400 Bad Request

Request parameters are invalid or missing required fields.

```
{
  "error": "Bad Request",
  "message": "Some users are not in the team"
}
```

### 401 Unauthorized

Invalid or missing API key.

```
{
  "error": "Unauthorized",
  "message": "Invalid API key"
}
```

### 403 Forbidden

Valid API key but insufficient permissions (e.g., Enterprise features on non-Enterprise plan).

```
{
  "error": "Forbidden",
  "message": "Enterprise access required"
}
```

### 404 Not Found

Requested resource doesn't exist.

```
{
  "error": "Not Found",
  "message": "Resource not found"
}
```

### 429 Too Many Requests

Rate limit exceeded. Implement exponential backoff.

```
{
  "error": "Too Many Requests",
  "message": "Rate limit exceeded. Please try again later."
}
```

### 500 Internal Server Error

Server-side error. Contact support if persistent.

```
{
  "error": "Internal Server Error",
  "message": "An unexpected error occurred"
}
```
