# Getting a Request ID

When the Cursor team is investigating a technical issue, we may ask for a "request ID".

## What is a request ID?

A request ID uniquely identifies each request to Cursor in our internal systems.

Format example: `8f2a5b91-4d3e-47c6-9f12-5e8d94ca7d23`

## How do I find a request ID?

Request IDs are limited when Privacy Mode is enabled. Disable Privacy Mode when reporting issues.

Note: Business plan users have Privacy Mode enabled by default by their organization's admin.

### Getting your current request ID

To report an issue with your current or recent conversation:

With the conversation open in the Chat sidebar, use the context menu (top right) and select `Copy Request ID`.

Send the copied request ID to us via the forum or email as requested.

### Getting a request ID from a previous action

Retrieve historical request IDs using the `Report AI Action` command:

Open command palette `⌘⇧P`
Type `Report AI Action`
Select the `Report AI Action` option

This displays your recent AI actions across Chat, CMD+K, and Apply.

Select the action by matching its time and feature. Copy the request ID and send it to us.
