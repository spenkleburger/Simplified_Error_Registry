## Overview

Cursor's Agent on web brings a powerful coding assistant to every device. Whether you're on your phone during a walk, or working in your web browser, you can now kick off powerful coding agents that work in the cloud.
When they're done, you can pick up their work inside Cursor, review and merge changes, or share links with your team to collaborate.

Get started at [cursor.com/agents](https://cursor.com/agents).

## Getting started

### Quick setup

Visit the web app: Go to [cursor.com/agents](https://cursor.com/agents) on any device
Sign in: Log in with your Cursor account
Connect GitHub: Link your GitHub account to access repositories
Start your first agent: Type in a task and watch the agent get to work

### Mobile installation

For the best mobile experience, install Cursor as a Progressive Web App (PWA):

iOS: Open [cursor.com/agents](https://cursor.com/agents) in Safari, tap the share button, then "Add to Home Screen"
Android: Open the URL in Chrome, tap the menu, then "Add to Home Screen" or "Install App"

Installing as a PWA provides a native-feeling experience with: full-screen
interface, faster startup times, and an app icon on your home screen.

## Working across devices

The Web and Mobile Agent is designed to work with your desktop workflow; click "Open in Cursor" to continue the agent's work in your IDE.

### Team collaboration

Shared access: Share links with team members to collaborate on agent runs.
Review process: Collaborators can review diffs and provide feedback.
Pull request management: Create, review, and merge pull requests directly from the web interface.

### Slack integration

Trigger agents directly from Slack by mentioning `@Cursor`, and when starting agents from web or mobile, opt to receive Slack notifications upon completion.
