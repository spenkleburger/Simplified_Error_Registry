# Secret Audit with Cursor CLI

Audit your repository for security vulnerabilities and secrets exposure using Cursor CLI. This workflow scans for potential secrets, detects risky workflow patterns, and proposes security fixes.

Example: `.github/workflows/secret-audit.yml`

```
name: Secrets Audit

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 4 * * *"
  workflow_dispatch:

permissions:
  contents: write
  pull-requests: write
  actions: read

jobs:
  secrets-audit:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0

      - name: Install Cursor CLI
        run: |
          curl https://cursor.com/install -fsS | bash
          echo "$HOME/.cursor/bin" >> $GITHUB_PATH

      - name: Configure git identity
        run: |
          git config user.name "Cursor Agent"
          git config user.email "cursoragent@cursor.com"

      - name: Scan and propose hardening
        env:
          CURSOR_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.CURSOR_API_KEY }}
          MODEL: gpt-5
          GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          BRANCH_PREFIX: audit
        run: |
          cursor-agent -p "You are operating in a GitHub Actions runner.

          The GitHub CLI is available as `gh` and authenticated via `GH_TOKEN`. Git is available. You have write access to repository contents and can comment on pull requests, but you must not create or edit PRs directly.

          # Context:
          - Repo: ${{ github.repository }}
           - Hardening Branch Prefix: ${{ env.BRANCH_PREFIX }}

          # Goal:
          - Perform a repository secrets exposure and workflow hardening audit on a schedule, and propose minimal safe fixes.

          # Requirements:
          1) Scan for potential secrets in tracked files and recent history; support allowlist patterns if present (e.g., .gitleaks.toml).
          2) Detect risky workflow patterns: unpinned actions, overbroad permissions, unsafe pull_request_target usage, secrets in forked PR contexts, deprecated insecure commands, missing permissions blocks.
          3) Maintain a persistent branch for this run using the Hardening Branch Prefix from Context. Create it if missing, update it otherwise, and push changes to origin.
          4) Propose minimal edits: redact literals where safe, add ignore rules, pin actions to SHA, reduce permissions, add guardrails to workflows, and add a SECURITY_LOG.md summarizing changes and remediation guidance.
          5) Push to origin.
          6) If there is at least one open PR in the repo, post or update a single natural-language comment (1–2 sentences) on the most recently updated open PR that briefly explains the hardening changes and includes an inline compare link to quick-create a PR.
          7) Avoid duplicate comments; update an existing bot comment if present. If no changes or no open PRs, post nothing.

          # Inputs and conventions:
          - Use `gh` to list PRs and to post comments. Avoid duplicate comments.

          # Deliverables when updates occur:
           - Pushed commits to the persistent hardening branch for this run.
          - A single natural-language PR comment with the compare link above (only if an open PR exists).
