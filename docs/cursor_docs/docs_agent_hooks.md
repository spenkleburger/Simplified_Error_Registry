# Hooks

Hooks let you observe, control, and extend the agent loop using custom scripts. Hooks are spawned processes that communicate over stdio using JSON in both directions. They run before or after defined stages of the agent loop and can observe, block, or modify behavior.

With hooks, you can:

Run formatters after edits
Add analytics for events
Scan for PII or secrets
Gate risky operations (e.g., SQL writes)

## Agent and Tab Support

Hooks work with both Cursor Agent (Cmd+K/Agent Chat) and Cursor Tab (inline completions), but they use different hook events:

Agent (Cmd+K/Agent Chat) uses the standard hooks:

`beforeShellExecution` / `afterShellExecution` - Control shell commands
`beforeMCPExecution` / `afterMCPExecution` - Control MCP tool usage
`beforeReadFile` / `afterFileEdit` - Control file access and edits
`beforeSubmitPrompt` - Validate prompts before submission
`stop` - Handle agent completion
`afterAgentResponse` / `afterAgentThought` - Track agent responses

Tab (inline completions) uses specialized hooks:

`beforeTabFileRead` - Control file access for Tab completions
`afterTabFileEdit` - Post-process Tab edits

These separate hooks allow different policies for autonomous Tab operations versus user-directed Agent operations.

## Quickstart

Create a `hooks.json` file. You can create it at the project level (`<project>/.cursor/hooks.json`) or in your home directory (`~/.cursor/hooks.json`). Project-level hooks apply only to that specific project, while home directory hooks apply globally.

```
{
  "version": 1,
  "hooks": {
    "afterFileEdit": [{ "command": "./hooks/format.sh" }]
  }
}
```

Create your hook script at `~/.cursor/hooks/format.sh`:

```
#!/bin/bash
# Read input, do something, exit 0
cat > /dev/null
exit 0
```

Make it executable:

```
chmod +x ~/.cursor/hooks/format.sh
```

Restart Cursor. Your hook now runs after every file edit.

## Examples

hooks.jsonaudit.shblock-git.shredact-secrets.shformat-tab.shredact-secrets-tab.sh
```
{
  "version": 1,
  "hooks": {
    "beforeShellExecution": [
      {
        "command": "./hooks/audit.sh"
      },
      {
        "command": "./hooks/block-git.sh"
      }
    ],
    "beforeMCPExecution": [
      {
        "command": "./hooks/audit.sh"
      }
    ],
    "afterShellExecution": [
      {
        "command": "./hooks/audit.sh"
      }
    ],
    "afterMCPExecution": [
      {
        "command": "./hooks/audit.sh"
      }
    ],
    "beforeReadFile": [
      {
        "command": "./hooks/redact-secrets.sh"
      }
    ],
    "afterFileEdit": [
      {
        "command": "./hooks/audit.sh"
      }
    ],
    "beforeSubmitPrompt": [
      {
        "command": "./hooks/audit.sh"
      }
    ],
    "stop": [
      {
        "command": "./hooks/audit.sh"
      }
    ],
    "beforeTabFileRead": [
      {
        "command": "./hooks/redact-secrets-tab.sh"
      }
    ],
    "afterTabFileEdit": [
      {
        "command": "./hooks/format-tab.sh"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Configuration

Define hooks in a `hooks.json` file. Configuration can exist at multiple levels; higher-priority sources override lower ones:

```
~/.cursor/
├── hooks.json
└── hooks/
    ├── audit.sh
    ├── block-git.sh
    └── redact-secrets.sh
```

Project (Project-specific):

`<project>/.cursor/hooks.json`

Home Directory (User-specific):

`~/.cursor/hooks.json`

Global (Enterprise-managed):

macOS: `/Library/Application Support/Cursor/hooks.json`
Linux/WSL: `/etc/cursor/hooks.json`
Windows: `C:\\ProgramData\\Cursor\\hooks.json`

The `hooks` object maps hook names to arrays of hook definitions. Each definition currently supports a `command` property that can be a shell string, an absolute path, or a path relative to the `hooks.json` file.

### Configuration file

```
{
  "version": 1,
  "hooks": {
    "beforeShellExecution": [{ "command": "./script.sh" }],
    "afterShellExecution": [{ "command": "./script.sh" }],
    "afterMCPExecution": [{ "command": "./script.sh" }],
    "afterFileEdit": [{ "command": "./format.sh" }],
    "beforeTabFileRead": [{ "command": "./redact-secrets-tab.sh" }],
    "afterTabFileEdit": [{ "command": "./format-tab.sh" }]
  }
}
```

The Agent hooks (`beforeShellExecution`, `afterShellExecution`, `beforeMCPExecution`, `afterMCPExecution`, `beforeReadFile`, `afterFileEdit`, `beforeSubmitPrompt`, `stop`, `afterAgentResponse`, `afterAgentThought`) apply to Cmd+K and Agent Chat operations. The Tab hooks (`beforeTabFileRead`, `afterTabFileEdit`) apply specifically to inline Tab completions.

## Team Distribution

Hooks can be distributed to team members using MDM tools or Cursor's cloud distribution system.

### MDM Distribution

Distribute hooks across your organization using Mobile Device Management (MDM) tools. Place the `hooks.json` file and hook scripts in the target directories on each machine.

User home directory (per-user distribution):

`~/.cursor/hooks.json`
`~/.cursor/hooks/` (for hook scripts)

Global directories (system-wide distribution):

macOS: `/Library/Application Support/Cursor/hooks.json`
Linux/WSL: `/etc/cursor/hooks.json`
Windows: `C:\\ProgramData\\Cursor\\hooks.json`

Note: MDM-based distribution is fully managed by your organization. Cursor does not deploy or manage files through your MDM solution. Ensure your internal IT or security team handles configuration, deployment, and updates in accordance with your organization's policies.

### Cloud Distribution (Enterprise Only)

Enterprise teams can use Cursor's native cloud distribution to automatically sync hooks to all team members. Configure hooks in the [web dashboard](https://cursor.com/dashboard?tab=team-content&section=hooks). Cursor automatically delivers configured hooks to all client machines when team members log in.

Cloud distribution provides:

Automatic synchronization to all team members (every thirty minutes)
Operating system targeting for platform-specific hooks
Centralized management through the dashboard

Enterprise administrators can create, edit, and manage team hooks from the dashboard without requiring access to individual machines.

## Reference

### Common schema

#### Input (all hooks)

```
{
  "conversation_id": "string",
  "generation_id": "string",
  "hook_event_name": "string",
  "workspace_roots": ["<path>"]
}
```

### Hook events

#### beforeShellExecution / beforeMCPExecution

Called before any shell command or MCP tool is executed. Return a permission decision.

```
// beforeShellExecution input
{
  "command": "<full terminal command>",
  "cwd": "<current working directory>"
}

// beforeMCPExecution input
{
  "tool_name": "<tool name>",
  "tool_input": "<json params>"
}
// Plus either:
{ "url": "<server url>" }
// Or:
{ "command": "<command string>" }

// Output
{
  "permission": "allow" | "deny" | "ask",
  "user_message": "<message shown in client>",
  "agent_message": "<message sent to agent>"
}
```

#### afterShellExecution

Fires after a shell command executes; useful for auditing or collecting metrics from command output.

```
// Input
{
  "command": "<full terminal command>",
  "output": "<full terminal output>"
}
```

#### afterMCPExecution

Fires after an MCP tool executes; includes the tool's input parameters and full JSON result.

```
// Input
{
  "tool_name": "<tool name>",
  "tool_input": "<json params>",
  "result_json": "<tool result json>"
}
```

#### afterFileEdit

Fires after the Agent edits a file; useful for formatters or accounting of agent-written code.

```
// Input
{
  "file_path": "<absolute path>",
  "edits": [{ "old_string": "<search>", "new_string": "<replace>" }]
}
```

#### beforeReadFile

Enable redaction or access control before the Agent reads a file. Includes any prompt attachments for auditing rules inclusion.

```
// Input
{
  "file_path": "<absolute path>",
  "content": "<file contents>",
  "attachments": [
    {
      "type": "rule",
      "file_path": "<absolute path>"
    }
  ]
}

// Output
{
  "permission": "allow" | "deny"
}
```

#### beforeTabFileRead

Called before Tab (inline completions) reads a file. Enable redaction or access control before Tab accesses file contents.

Key differences from `beforeReadFile`:

Only triggered by Tab, not Agent
Does not include `attachments` field (Tab doesn't use prompt attachments)
Useful for applying different policies to autonomous Tab operations

```
// Input
{
  "file_path": "<absolute path>",
  "content": "<file contents>"
}

// Output
{
  "permission": "allow" | "deny"
}
```

#### afterTabFileEdit

Called after Tab (inline completions) edits a file. Useful for formatters or auditing of Tab-written code.

Key differences from `afterFileEdit`:

Only triggered by Tab, not Agent
Includes detailed edit information: `range`, `old_line`, and `new_line` for precise edit tracking
Useful for fine-grained formatting or analysis of Tab edits

```
// Input
{
  "file_path": "<absolute path>",
  "edits": [
    {
      "old_string": "<search>",
      "new_string": "<replace>",
      "range": {
        "start_line_number": 10,
        "start_column": 5,
        "end_line_number": 10,
        "end_column": 20
      },
      "old_line": "<line before edit>",
      "new_line": "<line after edit>"
    }
  ]
}

// Output
{
  // No output fields currently supported
}
```

#### beforeSubmitPrompt

Called right after user hits send but before backend request. Can prevent submission.

```
// Input
{
  "prompt": "<user prompt text>",
  "attachments": [
    {
      "type": "file" | "rule",
      "filePath": "<absolute path>"
    }
  ]
}

// Output
{
  "continue": true | false
}
```

#### afterAgentResponse

Called after the agent has completed an assistant message.

```
// Input
{
  "text": "<assistant final text>"
}
```

#### stop

Called when the agent loop ends. Can optionally auto-submit a follow-up user message to keep iterating.

```
// Input
{
  "status": "completed" | "aborted" | "error",
  "loop_count": 0
}
```

```
// Output
{
  "followup_message": "<message text>"
}
```

The optional `followup_message` is a string. When provided and non-empty, Cursor will automatically submit it as the next user message. This enables loop-style flows (e.g., iterate until a goal is met).
The `loop_count` field indicates how many times the stop hook has already triggered an automatic follow-up for this conversation (starts at 0). To prevent infinite loops, a maximum of 5 auto follow-ups is enforced.

## Troubleshooting

How to confirm hooks are active

There is a Hooks tab in Cursor Settings to debug configured and executed hooks, as well as a Hooks output channel to see errors.

If hooks are not working

Restart Cursor to ensure the hooks service is running.
Ensure hook script paths are relative to `hooks.json` when using relative paths.
