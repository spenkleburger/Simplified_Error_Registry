# Compliance and Monitoring

Compliance requires visibility into who did what, when, and why. This documentation covers audit logs, AI code tracking, certifications, and how to meet regulatory requirements.

## Audit logs

Audit logs provide a record of security events and administrative actions. Available on Enterprise plans, audit logs help you meet compliance requirements and investigate security incidents.

We log the following events:

Authentication events: Logins and logouts
User management: User additions (via SSO, invite, signup, team creation, or auto-enrollment), removals, role changes, and individual spend limits
API key management: Team and user API key creation and revocation
Team settings: Team-wide and per-user spending limits, admin settings, team name changes, Slack integration settings, and repository mappings
Repository management: Repository creation, deletion, and settings updates
Directory groups: Directory group creation, updates, deletion, membership changes, and permission modifications
Privacy settings: Privacy Mode changes at user or team level
Team rules: Team rule management (including Bugbot rules) for custom workflows
Team commands: Custom command creation, updates, and deletion

We do not log agent responses or generated code content.

Instead, we recommend using [hooks](/docs/agent/hooks) to log prompts and code.

### Accessing audit logs

View audit logs in the [team dashboard](https://cursor.com/dashboard?tab=audit-log). This is available on Enterprise plans, and requires admin access.

### Streaming audit logs

For compliance and security monitoring, stream audit logs to your existing systems:

SIEM systems (Splunk, Sumo Logic, Datadog, etc.)
Webhook endpoints for custom processing
S3 buckets for long-term retention
Log aggregators like Elasticsearch or CloudWatch

Please contact [hi@cursor.com](mailto:hi@cursor.com) if you would like to receive streaming audit logs.

### Log format

Audit logs are delivered as JSON and include metadata and event-specific fields:

```
{
  "metadata": {
    "timestamp": "2024-10-14T18:30:45Z",
    "event_id": "evt_abc123xyz789"
  },
  "team_id": "team_xyz789",
  "ip_address": "203.0.113.42",
  "user_email": "alice@company.com",
  "event": { /* event-specific fields */ }
}
```

The event types include:

`login` - User login events (web or app)
`logout` - User logout events
`add_user` - User additions (with source: `sso`, `invite`, `signup`, `createTeam`, or `autoEnroll`)
`remove_user` - User removals from team
`update_user_role` - Role changes (OWNER, ADMIN, MEMBER)
`user_spend_limit` - Individual user spending limit changes
`team_api_key` - Team API key actions (create, revoke)
`user_api_key` - User API key actions (create, revoke)
`team_settings` - Team setting modifications, including:
`team_hard_limit_dollars` - Team-wide spending hard limit
`team_hard_limit_per_user_dollars` - Per-user hard limit
`per_user_monthly_limit_dollars` - Monthly spending limits per user
`admin_only_usage_pricing` - Admin-only usage pricing settings
`team_admin_settings` - General admin settings
`team_name` - Team name changes
`slack_default_repo` - Slack integration repository settings
`slack_default_branch` - Slack integration branch settings
`slack_default_model` - Slack integration model settings
`slack_share_summary` - Slack summary sharing settings
`slack_share_summary_in_external_channel` - External channel sharing
`slack_channel_repo_mappings` - Slack channel to repository mappings
`team_repo` - Repository actions (create, delete, update_settings)
`create_directory_group` - Directory group creation
`update_directory_group` - Directory group updates
`update_directory_group_permissions` - Directory group permission changes
`delete_directory_group` - Directory group deletion
`add_user_to_directory_group` - Adding users to directory groups
`remove_user_from_directory_group` - Removing users from directory groups
`privacy_mode` - Privacy Mode changes (scope: "user" or "team")
`team_rule` - Team rule management (create, update, delete)
`bugbot_team_rule` - Bugbot-specific rule management (create, update, delete)
`team_command` - Custom team command management (create, update, delete)

### Searching and filtering

Filter audit logs in the dashboard by:

Date range
Event type (authentication, user management, settings)
Actor (specific user)

Export filtered results to CSV for analysis or compliance reports.

## Using hooks for compliance logging

Audit logs track administrative actions, but some compliance requirements need logging of development activity. Use hooks to log:

### Prompts submitted hook

```
#!/bin/bash
input=$(cat)
prompt=$(echo "$input" | jq -r '.prompt')
user_id=$(echo "$input" | jq -r '.user_id')

# Log to your compliance system
curl -X POST "https://compliance.company.com/log" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"type\":\"prompt\",\"user\":\"$user_id\",\"timestamp\":\"$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)\"}"

cat << EOF
{
  "continue": true
}
EOF
```

### Code generated hook

```
#!/bin/bash
input=$(cat)
file_path=$(echo "$input" | jq -r '.file_path')
edits=$(echo "$input" | jq -r '.edits')

# Log the code generation event (not the actual code)
curl -X POST "https://compliance.company.com/log" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"type\":\"generation\",\"file\":\"$file_path\",\"timestamp\":\"$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)\"}"

exit 0
```

Important: Be careful logging actual code or prompts. They may contain sensitive information. Log metadata (who, when, what file) rather than content when possible.

See [Hooks](/docs/agent/hooks) for hook implementation details.
