# bootstrap: load global rules by explicit path

At the start of each chat in this project:

1) Load global rules from this folder (recursively):
- C:\Projects\Simplified_Error_Registry\.cursor\rules\global

2) Enumerate all *.mdc files under that folder, then read each one.

3) If you cannot enumerate the folder, at minimum read these two files:
- C:\Projects\Simplified_Error_Registry\.cursor\rules\global\rules.mdc
- C:\Projects\Simplified_Error_Registry\.cursor\rules\global\ports.mdc

4) Confirm you will follow the loaded rules in this chat.

If you cannot read them, say so and ask the user to run scripts\\verify_symlinks.ps1.
