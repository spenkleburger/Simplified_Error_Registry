# writing guidelines

## sentence structure, voice, and tone
- Write like humans speak; avoid corporate jargon or marketing fluff.
- Be confident and direct—skip softeners like "I think," "maybe," or "could."
- Keep sentences in active voice.
- Use positive phrasing; describe what something is instead of what it isn't.
- Address external audiences as "you" more than "we."
- Prefer contractions such as "I'll," "won't," and "can't."

## specificity and evidence
- Use concrete facts and data instead of vague superlatives.
- Support claims with examples or metrics.
- Emphasize customers and communities rather than company achievements.
- Favor realistic, product-based examples over foo/bar/baz.
- Make content concrete, visual, and falsifiable.

## title creation
- Promise value in the title so readers know what they'll learn.
- Reference controversial viewpoints only when backed by data; avoid clickbait.
- Share uniquely helpful insights that make readers better at meaningful work.
- Skip vague titles like "My thoughts on XYZ"; offer opinions or shareable facts.
- Draft placeholder titles first, then iterate after the content is complete.

## banned words
Replace or remove the following terms:
- "a bit," "a little," "actually/actual," "agile," "arguably," "battle tested," "best practices" → use "proven approaches," "blazing fast/lightning fast" → "build XX% faster," "business logic," "cognitive load," "commence" → "start," "delve" → "go into," "disrupt/disruptive," "game-changing," "great," "innovative," "just," "mission-critical" → "important," "modern/modernized," "numerous" → "many," "out of the box," "performant" → "fast and reliable," "pretty/quite/rather/really/very," "referred to as" → "called," "remainder" → "rest," "robust" → "strong," "seamless/seamlessly" → "automatic," "sufficient" → "enough," "that" (remove when optional), "thing" (be specific), "webinar" → "online event."
- Replace "assistance" with "help," "attempt" with "try," "facilitate" with "help" or "ease," "implement" with "do," "individual" with "man" or "woman," "initial" with "first," "leverage" with "use," "utilize" with "use."

## banned phrases
Remove or rephrase:
- "I think/I believe/we believe," "it seems," "sort of/kind of," "pretty much," "a lot/a little."
- Marketing clichés such as "By developers, for developers," "We can't wait to see what you'll build," "We obsess over ___," "The future of ___."
- "We're excited" → "We look forward."
- "Today, we're excited to …"

## avoid llm patterns
- Replace em dashes with semicolons, commas, or sentence breaks.
- Don't start responses with "Great question!," "You're right!," or "Let me help you."
- Skip phrases like "Let's dive into…," "In today's fast-paced digital world…," "In the ever-evolving landscape of…," "It's not just [x], it's [y]."
- Omit self-referential lines such as "As an AI…" or "I'm here to help you…"
- Don't wrap up with "In conclusion," "Overall," or "To summarize."
- Favor bullet lists over numbered lists when possible.
- Avoid closing with "Hope this helps!" or similar.
- Use transition words sparingly; don't stack hedges like "may potentially" or "it's important to note that."
- Don't build perfectly symmetric paragraphs or "Firstly… Secondly…" lists.
- Use sentence case for headings.
- Remove Unicode artifacts (smart quotes, em dashes, non-breaking spaces).
- Prefer triple backticks ``` for code blocks.
- Delete empty citation placeholders such as "[1]."

## punctuation and formatting
- Use Oxford commas consistently and keep exclamation points rare.
- Starting sentences with "But" or "And" is fine—just don't overdo it.
- Prefer periods over commas when they clarify meaning.
