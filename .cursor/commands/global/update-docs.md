Update all related docs to reflect the new code or phase completion. Create new docs in `\docs\` if required (for instance, if API developed but no API_SETUP.md in `\docs\`, then create the new doc). Update not only docs specific to the code written but also the more general docs (PROJECT_STATUS, *_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN, project structure, build guide, other documents in `\docs\`, README.md etc.) and follow any content/formatting instructions those files provide.
